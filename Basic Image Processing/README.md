## Description
This task demonstrates basic operations of Digital Image Processing using MATLAB.  
The task includes matrix creation and simple image processing techniques.

## Tasks Performed
- Created an 8×8 matrix with random values between 0 and 255
- Read and displayed an RGB image
- Converted RGB image to grayscale
- Extracted red color channel
- Converted grayscale image to binary using thresholding
- Applied histogram equalization for contrast enhancement

## Requirements
- MATLAB
- Image Processing Toolbox

## How to Run
1. Place `car.png` in the same folder as the MATLAB script.
2. Open the script in MATLAB.
3. Run the file.

## Output
The program displays:
- Original image
- Grayscale image
- Red channel image
- Binary image
- Histogram equalized image
